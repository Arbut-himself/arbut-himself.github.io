<h1>Placeholder webpage</h1>
<p>Hello, 
    <br>This webpage is currently empty. I currently have no clue how HTML, CSS or JS works.
    <br>However, I currently am starting self learning journey of learning exactly that.
    <br>So for now this is how it is and I am just figuring out how to host websites for free.
    <br>Here's hoping it works.</p>
